# Substrate Design System â€” Style Dictionary

Style Dictionary is a build tool to generate design tokens across platforms and for use in Figma.

## Automatically generate separate build files matching categories and components

This config of Style Dictionary generates a 1:1 relationship between build files and token categories.

The use cases:

- Each token category as its own Sass partial (_colors.scss)
- Separate component files (button.css, input.css, etc)
- Tree shaking (only import what you need)

## Running the example

First of all, set up the required dependencies running the command `npm install` in your local CLI environment.

At this point, you can run `npm run build`. This command will generate the output file in the `build` folder. Currently the build process exprects style dictionary to be in the same parent directory as the components repository where the stencil components live as they are exported to
`/components/src/assets/tokens` directory.

### Exporting for Figma tokens

```bash
npm run build-figma-tokens
```

After this, tokens will be available in the `figma-tokens/figma-tokens.json` file.

If you use jsonbin.io for your tokens, you can use this script to push tokens:

```postman
curl    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "secret-key: [your-secret-key-here] " \
        --request PUT \
        --data-binary "@figma-tokens.json" \
        https://api.jsonbin.io/b/[your-bin-id-here]
```


### How does it work

The "build" command processes the JSON files in the `tokens` folder. The `index.js` file adds each folder, allowing you to map through them in `config.js`. The script goes through each folder and generates a file for each folder and populates it with tokens that match the filter.

```sh
# tokens/color/base.json
{
   "color": {
       "red": {
            "value": "#FF0000"
        }
   }
}
```

```sh
# tokens/size/base.json
{
   "size": {
       "small": {
            "value": "2px"
        }
   }
}
```

Because the folder name matches the category, the output would automatically generate separate `color` and `size` files.

### What to look at

Open the `config.js` file and see how the script first looks within the `tokens` directory to map through each folder. The destination then outputs a file that would match the name, and fill that file with the tokens that match the filter criteria.

```sh
 files: tokens.map(tokenCategory => ({
          destination: `${tokenCategory}.js`,
          format: "format/js",
          filter: {
            attributes: {
              category: tokenCategory
            }
          }
        }))
```

Now each new folder that gets added will automatically generate a corresponding file filled with tokens that match the category!
